            This Hanukkah brisket will literally fall apart in your mouth. The recipe was given to me by my Jewish friend. We made it for a work potluck, and it was a hit.

            Ingridients:
        </h1>
        <ul class="text">
            <li> 1 (4 pound) beef brisket </li>
            <li> 1 large onion, sliced </li>
            <li> 2 (14.5 ounce) cans beef broth </li>
            <li> 2 (15 ounce) cans French onion soup </li>

            Directions:
        </h1>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a large roasting pan over medium-high heat. Sear brisket, fat-side down first, in the hot pan until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove brisket from the pan and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place onion slices into the bottom of the same roasting pan; pour 1 can beef broth, 1 can French onion soup, and 1 can beer over onions. Lay brisket on top; pour remaining beef broth, French onion soup, and beer over brisket. Cover the roasting pan with a lid.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Let brisket stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove brisket from the roasting pan and wrap tightly in aluminum foil. Pour pan juices and onion into a food storage container and cover tightly with a lid. Refrigerate brisket and pan juices, 8 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour pan juices and onion into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unwrap brisket, cut away any visible fat, and slice thinly across the grain of the meat. Place brisket slices into pan juices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until pan juices are thickened and meat is hot, about 45 minutes.
            </li>
